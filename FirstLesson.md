# First Lesson
This is the beggining of the programming and collaboration journey. The result should be an understanding of
creating GO files with the proper syntax so that they will execute. The lesson will revolve around a package
to compute the solar noon based upon a location on the planet earth.

## Objectives
1. Determine programming requirements
1. Determine any user requirements
1. Transition requirements to specifications
1. Implement specifications
1. Test
1. Demonstrate functionality
1. Review what was learned, what issues encountered, and what to improve
